# crowdfunding_back_end
A repo to contain my She Codes Crowdfunding back end project

## `README.md` Template Phase 1: API Plan

As your Crowdfunding back end grows, you'll have more and more information to put in the `readme.md` file. For now, you have a rough plan for your project, so let's mark it down!

Below is a template you can use to add your plan to your readme. As usual, {{ double brackets }} indicate places where you should insert your own content. So if your name was Sinead O'Connor, you would swap `Hi, my name is {{ your_name_here }}!` to `Hi, my name is Sinead O'Connor!`

If you're looking for a good way to create your Schema diagram in VS Code, check out [the draw.io integration extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio)!

To make editing tables in Markdown easier, you might enjoy [the Markdown All-In-One extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one). With this installed, you can hit tab inside of any "cell" in a table, and the editor will automatically resize all your columns and create a new row if necessary.

```markdown
# Crowdfunding Back End
{{ your name here }}

## Planning:
### Concept/Name
{{ Include a short description of your website concept here. }}

### Intended Audience/User Stories
{{ Who are your intended audience? How will they use the website? }}

### Front End Pages/Functionality
- {{ A page on the front end }}
    - {{ A list of dot-points showing functionality is available on this page }}
    - {{ etc }}
    - {{ etc }}
- {{ A second page available on the front end }}
    - {{ Another list of dot-points showing functionality }}
    - {{ etc }}

### API Spec
{{ Fill out the table below to define your endpoints. An example of what this might look like is shown at the bottom of the page. 

It might look messy here in the PDF, but once it's rendered it looks very neat! 

It can be helpful to keep the markdown preview open in VS Code so that you can see what you're typing more easily. }}
